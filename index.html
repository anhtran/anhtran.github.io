		<h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>A web/mobile app developer with passion making the elegant design and easy-to-use products.
            I like to go with simple approaches but will pick up the long term way if needed. I also tend to do things
            consistently and have a bit greedy.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I own some stuff, several small businesses. I love them and invest in them.</p>
        <p>I experiment more and more in my workspace every single day. As a fan of many languages in field, I felt
            ashamed because did not have enough concentration in open source community. This time I am comfortable
            working with Scala, Python, Go and Javascript.
        </p>

        <h2>Where I Live</h2>
        <p>A highlander and living in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon).</p>

        <h2>What the heck am I doing here?</h2>
        <p>Calm down man! Maybe Google directs you to here. Just click `Back`.</p>
